# encryption---v1
In this version of my secrets website I have used mongoose-encryption to encrypt the password of the users.
It's a basic level encryption which i used here in this we have used mongoDB to store the id and password of the user while the registration process and while login see inside the DB for the same if found the allows the user to visit the feauters of the website. 
It uses hashing and salting to make the data stored secured.
